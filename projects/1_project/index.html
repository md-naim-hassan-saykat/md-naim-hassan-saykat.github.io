The system integrates multiple architectures—CNN, ResNet50, DenseNet121, EfficientNetB3, ConvNeXt-Tiny, MobileNetV3, and Vision Transformer (ViT)—to improve melanoma detection and reduce model variance.</p> <p>Models were trained on the HAM10000 dataset and externally validated on ISIC 2019 to evaluate cross-dataset robustness. Comprehensive evaluation includes per-class metrics, ROC–AUC, confusion matrices, ensemble fusion strategies, and explainable AI visualizations using Grad-CAM.</p> <p>This work is part of a Q1-journal submission on generalizable medical imaging AI systems.</p> </body></html>

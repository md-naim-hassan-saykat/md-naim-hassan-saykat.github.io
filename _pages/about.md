I am **Md Naim Hassan Saykat**, an AI researcher specializing in **Computer Vision, Medical Imaging, Deep Learning, and Transformer-based models**. I am currently pursuing my Master’s in Artificial Intelligence at **Université Paris-Saclay**, where my work focuses on developing **generalizable, efficient, and explainable deep learning systems** for real-world diagnostic settings.

My research interests include:

- **Medical image analysis** (dermatology, radiology, X-ray interpretation)  
- **Vision Transformers (ViT)** and **hybrid CNN–Transformer architectures**  
- **Explainable AI** (Grad-CAM, attention mechanisms, model interpretability)  
- **Domain adaptation and cross-dataset generalization** (HAM10000 → ISIC)  
- **Efficient and edge-optimized AI models** for deployment in resource-constrained environments  

I have led and completed several end-to-end research projects, including:  
- Deep ensemble models for **skin lesion classification**  
- **CycleGAN**-based unpaired medical image translation  
- **Patent reranking** using dense retrievers + cross-encoders  
- Transformer-driven pipelines for medical imaging and AI explainability  

I am actively seeking opportunities for **research collaborations**, **journal publications**, and **PhD positions** in AI, Computer Vision, and Medical Imaging.

Feel free to explore my research and code on GitHub:

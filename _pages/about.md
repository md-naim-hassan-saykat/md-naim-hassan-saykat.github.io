I am **Md Naim Hassan Saykat**, an AI researcher specializing in **Computer Vision, Medical Imaging, Deep Learning, and Transformer-based architectures**.  
I am currently pursuing my Master’s in Artificial Intelligence at **Université Paris-Saclay**, where my work focuses on building **generalizable, explainable, and efficient deep learning systems** for real-world diagnostic and healthcare applications.

My research interests include:

- **Medical Image Analysis** (dermatology, radiology, X-ray interpretation)  
- **Vision Transformers (ViT)** and **hybrid CNN–Transformer models**  
- **Explainable AI (XAI)** — Grad-CAM, attention maps, feature attribution  
- **Domain adaptation & cross-dataset robustness** (e.g., HAM10000 → ISIC 2019)  
- **Edge-efficient & deployable AI** for low-resource clinical environments  

I have led and delivered multiple end-to-end research projects, including:  

- **Generalizable Deep Ensemble Models for Skin Lesion Classification**  
- **Explainable Vision Transformer pipelines** for medical imaging  
- **CycleGAN-based unpaired image-to-image translation** for medical domains  
- **Patent reranking using dense retrievers + cross-encoders**  
- **Transformer-driven explainability frameworks** for clinical decision support  

My work emphasizes **robustness**, **clinical interpretability**, and **publishable research quality**, and I am actively preparing manuscripts for **Q1 journal submissions**.

I am currently seeking opportunities for:  
- **Research collaborations**  
- **Journal and conference publications**  
- **PhD positions** in Computer Vision, Medical Imaging, or Multimodal AI

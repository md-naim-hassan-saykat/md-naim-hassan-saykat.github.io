I am **Md Naim Hassan Saykat**, an AI researcher specializing in **Computer Vision, Medical Imaging, Deep Learning, and Transformers**.  
I am currently pursuing my Master’s at **Université Paris-Saclay**, where I develop generalizable and explainable deep learning systems for real-world diagnostic applications.

My research focuses on:

- **Medical image classification** (dermatology, radiology, X-ray interpretation)  
- **Vision Transformers (ViT) and hybrid CNN–Transformer models**  
- **Explainable AI (Grad-CAM, attention-based interpretability)**  
- **Generalization across datasets** (HAM10000 → ISIC, cross-domain validation)  
- **Edge-ready and efficient AI models** for deployment in resource-limited environments  

I have completed multiple end-to-end research projects, including advanced deep learning ensembles for skin lesion classification, CycleGAN-based image translation, patent reranking using dense + cross encoders, and transformer-based medical image analysis.

I am actively seeking **research collaborations**, **publication opportunities**, and **PhD positions** in AI, Computer Vision, or Medical Imaging.

Feel free to check out my code and projects on GitHub:  
-  Research Portfolio → <https://github.com/md-naim-hassan-saykat>  
-  Skin Lesion Classification (HAM10000) → <https://github.com/md-naim-hassan-saykat/skin-lesion-classification-ensemble-ham10000>

If you would like to collaborate on impactful AI research, feel free to reach out.

This project presents a robust and generalizable deep learning ensemble for automated skin lesion classification. 
The system integrates multiple architectures—CNN, ResNet50, DenseNet121, EfficientNetB3, ConvNeXt-Tiny, MobileNetV3, 
and Vision Transformer (ViT)—to improve melanoma detection and reduce model variance.

Models were trained on the HAM10000 dataset and externally validated on ISIC 2019 to evaluate cross-dataset robustness. 
Comprehensive evaluation includes per-class metrics, ROC–AUC, confusion matrices, ensemble fusion strategies, and 
explainable AI visualizations using Grad-CAM.

This work is part of a Q1-journal submission on generalizable medical imaging AI systems.
